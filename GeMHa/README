The Generic Message Handler (GeMHa) is an application facilitating
communication between applications, including across servers, usually in the
form of XML messages.

It also allows presentation of simplified database actions (SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE, DELETE) to a specified database and return of a response, all via
XML messages.

The entry point for using this project are the following classes:

	GemhaBatch            creates a GenericMessageHandler instance and sets things in motion.
	GenericMessageHandler controls all the activity of a particular instance,
                          loading the appropriate classes based on the settings
                          in a configuration file.
